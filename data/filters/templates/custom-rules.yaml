This template allows you to keep custom rules in your list, to sync between browsers. Just write them as you would in the `My filters` page of uBlock Origin settings.

Have a look at the following pages to learn about the syntax:

- The uBlock Origin wiki pages: [Static filter syntax](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax) and
  [Procedural cosmetic filters](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Procedural-cosmetic-filters).
- [This cheatsheet](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Wiki/SyntaxMeaningsThatAreActuallyHumanReadable.md) by DandelionSprout.

Of couse, if you think a filter would be useful to others, don't hesitate to [suggest it as a new filter](/help/contributing)!
