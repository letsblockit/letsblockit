This filter template allows you to hide selected products from the Amazon store. It comes with some presets
that might be useful for you, at the bottom of the parameters.

Instead of simple word matching, this template uses Regular Expressions to reduce the risk of false positives.
You should [read this documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)
to learn the syntax, but the following examples should help you get started:

- You can specify any sequence of characters that will be searched in the product title. For example:
    - `/Echo Show/` will match the `Echo Show 8` product, but not the `Echo Dot`
    - `/Cat/` will match `Cat Hammock`, but also `Catapult`
- For a case-insensitive search, simply add `i` at the end of your expression. For example:
    - `/cat/i` will match both `Cat`, `cat` and `CAT`
- To make sure you match on the exact word, you should use the `\b` "word boundary" matcher. For example:
    - `/\bcat\b/i` will match `Cat Food`, but not `Catapult` or `copycat`
- You can also use other operators for a better match, for example
    - `/\bcat(s)?\b/i` will match both occurrences of singular `Cat`, but also the plural `Cats`
