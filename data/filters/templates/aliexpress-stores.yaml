This filter template allows you to hide products from selected stores from the AliExpress search results.

Instead of simple word matching, this template uses Regular Expressions to reduce the risk of false positives.
As an example, there is a wave of "throwaway" stores using the names like "Shop 12345 Store", the `/Shop \d+ Store/`
pattern will hide articles sold by these stores.

You should [read this documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)
to learn the syntax, but the following examples should help you get started:

- You can specify any sequence of characters that will be searched in the store name of the product. For example:
  - `/Echo Show/` will match the products of the store name `Echo Show 8`, but not the `Echo Dot`
  - `/Store/` will match `Store Hammock`, but also `Storehouse`
- For a case-insensitive search, simply add `i` at the end of your expression. For example:
  - `/shop/i` will match both `Shop`, `shop` and `SHOP`
- To make sure you match on the exact word, you should use the `\b` "word boundary" matcher. For example:
  - `/\bstore\b/i` will match `Store Food`, but not `Storehouse` or `superstore`
- You can also use other operators for a better match, for example
  - `/\bstore(s)?\b/i` will match both occurrences of singular `Store`, but also the plural `Stores`
