When you click on a link and you look at the URL, do you see all kinds of utm_sources and utm_mediums, which make the URL longer?

If you do, you can remove them with this filter.

Please note that you can remove most of the tracking parameters with the AdGuard URL Tracking Protection list (which is shipped with uBO, but not enabled by default), but you can use this to easily create URL parameter filters.
