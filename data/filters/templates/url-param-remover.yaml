When you click on a link and you look at the URL, do you see all kinds of utm_sources and utm_mediums,
which make the URL longer? These are used to track you between websites. uBlockOrigin and AdGuard can
remove these parameters when you click on links, to protect your privacy.

We recommend using one of the two following community lists (click to install them):

- AdGuard's [URL Tracking Protection list](abp:subscribe?location=https%3A%2F%2Ffilters.adtidy.org%2Fwindows%2Ffilters%2F17.txt&title=AdGuard%20URL%20Tracking%20filter)
- DandelionSprout's [ClearURLs for uBo](abp:subscribe?location=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FDandelionSprout%2Fadfilt%2Fmaster%2FClearURLs%20for%20uBo%2Fclear_urls_uboified.txt&title=ClearURLs%20for%20uBlock%20Origin)

Additionally, you can use the template below to add custom rules and block specific parameters not
included in the lists above.
