Hacker News does not have a dark mode (yet). This template injects CSS rules to create an unofficial dark mode.

While it is not perfect, it works fine on desktop and mobile. Because the CSS rules are injected during the
page load, you might experience a flash of white background when loading the pages. This is unfortunately not
fixable.
