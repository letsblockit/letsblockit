With this filter format it is possible to filter out videos with any duration. This filter hides most
occurrences of this format:

- videos in the subscription and search pages
- dedicated shelves in the homepage and channel list

The input should be a regexp. In regexp '`\d`' is for every possible digit. Multiple options should be separated be a '`|`', some examples:

- less than a minute: `0:\d\d`
- between one and two minutes: `1:\d\d`
- one minute or more: `[1-9]:\d\d|\d\d:\d\d|\d:\d\d:\d\d|\d\d:\d\d:\d\d` or shorter `([1-9]|\d\d):\d\d|(\d|\d\d):\d\d:\d\d`
- less than 10 minutes: `\d:\d\d`
- 10 minutes or more: `[1-9]\d:\d\d|\d:\d\d:\d\d|\d\d:\d\d:\d\d` or shorter `[1-9]\d:\d\d|(\d|\d\d):\d\d:\d\d`
- between 10 and 25 minutes: `1\d:\d\d|2[0-5]:\d\d`
- less than one hour: `\d\d:\d\d`
- one hour or more: `1:\d\d:\d\d|\d\d:\d\d:\d\d` or shorter `(1|\d\d):\d\d:\d\d`
- 2 hours or more: `2:\d\d:\d\d|\d\d:\d\d:\d\d` or shorter `(2|\d\d):\d\d:\d\d`

So if you want a regexp with less than a minute and between one and two minutes, the rule becomes: `0:\d\d|1:\d\d` or shorter `[0-1]:\d\d`
