These rules remove related searches and related results from the YouTube search results, only leaving organic
matches for your search.

The results page is also modified by several other [of our YouTube templates](/filters/tag/youtube),
removing items such as [shorts](youtube-shorts) and [radios](youtube-mixes), or results from
[specific channels](youtube-channel) or with [specific keywords](youtube-video-title).
