# Shutting down the letsblock.it project and its official instance

Two years after being published, the letsblock.it project is used by hundreds of users and ran thanks to
[dozens of contributors](https://github.com/letsblockit/letsblockit/?tab=readme-ov-file#thanks-to-our-contributors)
and [financial sponsors](https://opencollective.com/letsblockit#section-contributors) who I am grateful for.

Unfortunately, we are fighting a losing battle in a commercial internet that is becoming more user-hostile everyday.
I decided to move on and shut it down. **This project is making the commercial web more bearable, but I'd rather spend
my energy on making the non-commercial web more attractive.** I want to support communities and applications that respect
their users and value what we have to say. These websites don't need letsblock.it rules, because they don't shove
low-quality content and anti-features down our throats.

## What will happen

**The project will cease operations at the end of June 2024**, meaning that:

  - The official instance hosted at letsblock.it will be shut down and its database destroyed.
  - Self-hosting will not be supported anymore, and no release of the server will happen after June. The GitHub
    project will be archived for a short while, then deleted.
  - In the meantime, security maintenance will continue, but the rules will not receive any fix or update.

## What's next for you

- Existing users can go to their [user preferences page](/user/account) to download a generated version
  of their rules, or export their parameters to use on another instance.

- I would be happy to support any user who wants to fork the project and carry it forward. If that's you,
  feel free to comment on [this discussion](https://github.com/letsblockit/letsblockit/discussions/663).
  If that were to happen, I would link to the new project from this page, so check in later.

- **I encourage you to look out for non-commercial or more user-centric alternatives to the websites
  you have been using letsblock.it for**, but in the meantime, you can check out:

  - The [uBlacklist extension](https://iorate.github.io/ublacklist/) to filter search results.
    Our copycats presets were sourced from [uBlock-Origin-dev-filter](https://github.com/quenhus/uBlock-Origin-dev-filter),
    that works fine with ublacklist.
  - Check out the [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/styl-us/) and
    [TamperMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/tampermonkey) extensions: they allow to chose from
    user-contributed modifications and tweaks to popular websites
  - Search through [browser extension lists](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/) to find extensions specific
    to some websites you visit
