## Contributing to the project

Thanks for your interest in moving this project forward! If you have any question or suggestion, don't hesitate to
[open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/xvello/letsblockit/issues) for any question or bug, or send us an email
at `hello@<this-domain>.it`.

### Contributing filters {#filters}

The best way you can help the project is by contributing new filters or improving existing ones:

- If you know how to open a pull request, check out
  [the syntax documentation](https://github.com/xvello/letsblockit/blob/main/data/filters/README.md) and
  [the existing filter sources](https://github.com/xvello/letsblockit/tree/main/data/filters). Please enable the
  `Allow edits by maintainers` option on your PR to allow me to help fix syntax issues.
- Don't hesitate to open a GitHub issue to suggest filter improvements, [open an account](https://github.com/join)
  and [use the relevant issue template](https://github.com/xvello/letsblockit/issues/new/choose).

*Please note the following scope limitations:*

- blocking ads and trackers is out of the scope of these filters, please contribute to
  [EasyList](https://easylist.to/) or [AdGuard](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/adguard-ad-filters) instead
- support for content blockers other than `uBlock Origin` is left out for now, to limit the maintenance cost
- as a protest against the toxic endeavours of the Facebook / Meta company, no filter improving any of its websites will
  be accepted in the project.

### Helping with the code {#code}

A detailed contribution documentation will come soon, but in the meantime, you can take a look at the repository:

- the page sources are located in `data/pages`, in [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/) and Markdown formats
- the golang backend code is in the `src/` folders
- if you want to run the server locally, you will need to apply the postgres schema at `src/db/schema.sql` first
- the frontend sources are in `src/assets`, assets are pre-generated with npm into `data/assets`

Please note that the website is designed to work without Javascript enabled, hence the choice of server-side rendering
and [progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement). Frontend
contributions are very welcome (this is not my area of expertise), but need to stay in this spirit.
