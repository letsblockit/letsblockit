## About this project

Do you feel like the Internet is harder to navigate every year, and even hostile at times? You are not alone.

[uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) is a popular browser extension to filter out ads, trackers and annoyances.
Thanks to communities like [EasyList](https://easylist.to/) and
[AdGuard](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/adguard-ad-filters) maintaining high-quality filter lists, we can enjoy a
less cluttered and distracting Internet.

*But uBlock Origin is more than an ad-blocker*: it is a high-performance, general-purpose content blocker that can
remove all sort of low-quality or distracting content. Unfortunately, it is not simple to harness its power:

- Because everyone has their own definition of "low-quality content", a single common list cannot work
- There is a steep learning curve to writing custom rules, and website updates can break them regularly
- Unless you use browser profile synchronisation, keeping your custom rules in sync is time-consuming

At [Let's Block It](https://letsblock.it/filters), you can browse a curated list of customizable content filters and
build your own personal list. Want to
[remove pinterest from search results](https://letsblock.it/filters/search-results),
[hide youtube shorts](https://letsblock.it/filters/youtube-shorts) or hide that annoying
["People also ask" box in google](https://letsblock.it/filters/google-search-cleanup)? We have you covered!
You already have custom rules you want to keep? [Add them to your list](https://letsblock.it/filters/custom-rules)
to keep them synced in all your browsers.

## Where do I start?

You can use [our filters](https://letsblock.it/filters) without an account, just set your options and
copy the result in your uBlock Origin settings (in the `My rules` tab). But we recommend creating an account to:

- benefit from the community fixes when the target websites are updated
- sync your filters on several devices

It's as easy as 1-2-3... and 4:

1. Install [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) if you don't already have it,
2. [Create an account](https://letsblock.it/user/account) to start your list,
3. Browse [the filter list](https://letsblock.it/filters), choose and customize your filters,
4. [Add your personal list](https://letsblock.it/help/use-list) to uBlock, on all your browsers, even
   [Firefox Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox),
5. Give back by [contributing new filters](https://letsblock.it/help/contributing) if you can!
